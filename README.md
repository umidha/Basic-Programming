# Basic-Programming

This repository contains codes for various basic algorithms.
Different languages are used to implement these algorithms.
Each code has its own readme.txt file to explain how the code is working.
The alogorithms implemented are from various fields such as Pattern recogonition, Adaptive filters, Micropocessors, Evolutionary algorithms and some general algorithms.

Thanks and enjoy coding.
